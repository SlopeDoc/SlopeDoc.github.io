title: Paths, Caches & Options
---

### Main paths

In order to simplify resource fetching and relative paths, multiple paths must be carefully set, either via CLI or in the main if needed:
!!! note "```std::string ProjectPath```"
    path from executable to current's project folder, ***must*** be set via CLI:
    ```
    ./project_exe --project_path /home/.../slope_project
    ```
??? note "```std::string ProjectDataPath```"
    path prefix for where to fetch data, by default equal to ```ProjectPath```. When loading an external data, it the given path is relative it will take this as a referential.
??? note "```std::string CachePath```"
    Where to store stuff that is generated by slope, like latex images or GIF decomposition. By default in the build file.
!!! note "```std::string ProjectViewsPath```"
    Where to store the persistant quantities like [persistant positions](../placement/persistant_placement) or [camera views](../Primitives/camera). By default will create a ```views``` folder in the ```ProjectPath``` (so that it is preserved in a git for instance).

Some other important variables can be set in the main file

### Paths to dependancies

The path to ```pdflatex``` and ```convert``` tools are automatically fetched by cmake but you can change them if needed:
!!! note "```std::string PathToPDFLATEX```"
!!! note "```std::string PathToConvert```"

### Screen resolution

All coordinates in slope are expressed in a relative manner wrt to screen size, in order to match your resolution, you can specify it by CLI, or set it via global variables:

```
./project_exe --project_path /home/.../slope_project --resolution 500x800
```

!!! note "```size_t ScreenResolutionWidth```"
!!! note "```size_t ScreenResolutionHeight```"

### Misc

!!! note "```Eigen::Vector3d DefaultBackgroundColor``` (rgb 0-1)"
