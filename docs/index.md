title: What is Slope?
---


Exporting scientific results or complicated concepts into pretty presentations is a very hard proces that very often leads to a sad succession of screenshots and equations.


But talking about graphics and geometry without 3D is both a waste of joy and clarity.

Hence we propose **Slope**, a 3D slide engine built on top of [Polyscope](https://polyscope.run/), which can be loaded on top of your scientific code!

The goal is to allow researchers, teachers and geometry lovers to easily illustrate concepts with *pretty & interactive* 3D slides and animations.
